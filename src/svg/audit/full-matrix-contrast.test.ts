// @vitest-environment node
//
// Durable regression net for the W4 fix round (contrast defect class fixed
// in this task: archetypes baking a text fill while assuming the theme's
// default background tone — see `../ink.ts`'s own header and the task
// report's "修复轮" section for the full defect family). Runs under the
// real Node platform (`installNodePlatform()`, same posture as
// `deck-audit.test.ts`) so `auditDeck`'s actual documented Node consumption
// path is exercised end-to-end.
//
// Scope: every canonical theme × every slide type × every archetype
// currently in that theme's curated set (now the full registered-archetype
// set for all four slide types on all but a small, explicitly-adjudicated
// handful of curation exclusions — see `themes/definitions.ts`). Each
// combination is rendered with `heading` populated on every slide type, plus
// `subheading` on `chapter`/`content` specifically — this task's defect
// class (and this task's own fix) lives on those two elements plus
// self-painted chapter-number watermarks/badges; `cover`/`ending`
// deliberately omit `subheading` — see below.
//
// Deliberately minimal otherwise — no `organization`/`date` meta, no
// `footnote`, no preceding chapter (so a content archetype's section-label
// kicker never renders), no `kpi_cards`(+delta)/`code`/`quote`/
// `architecture` components, no `cover`/`ending` subheading. Every one of
// those was tried while building this test and each surfaces a *different*,
// pre-existing, cross-cutting issue unrelated to this task's defect class:
//   - `colors.muted` (the org/meta/footnote/kicker token nearly every
//     archetype uses) is marginally under the 4.5:1 body floor against
//     several themes' own background — a theme-token-calibration gap, not
//     an archetype assuming the wrong background. Confirmed empirically:
//     the ratio is identical whether meta is sparse or rich, and shows up
//     on `colors.muted`-bearing text in nearly every cover/content/ending
//     archetype across ~8 of the 13 themes.
//   - every `cover`/`ending` archetype's *subheading/subtitle* also reads
//     `colors.muted` (unlike `chapter`/`content`, whose subheading uses
//     `colors.text`/`colors.accent`/`colors.primary` — the tokens this
//     task's own fix touches) — same token-calibration gap as the point
//     above, confirmed at the exact same ratios (2.31-2.61:1) against
//     bloom/classroom's own background.
//   - `cover-left-anchor.tsx`'s multi-`<tspan>` author/date/version line
//     gets mis-attributed by `findContrastIssues` to the left primary block
//     instead of the right white panel it actually sits on — a documented
//     `deck-audit.ts` blind spot (see that archetype's file header and the
//     task review's Important I1 "方法论说明"), not a rendering defect.
//   - the five sources `deck-audit.test.ts`'s own "understood pre-existing
//     low-contrast sources" block already documents and pins.
// Recalibrating `colors.muted` per theme, or fixing the tspan-attribution
// blind spot, are both out of this task's scope (the former is a
// theme-design call across 13 files, the latter touches `deck-audit.ts`,
// which the brief explicitly keeps hands off) — flagged in the task report
// as follow-up candidates rather than silently worked around here.
