 * Shared "turn a CLI target argument into a raw IR-shaped object plus its

 * when it sets one, else the user config's, else `resolveDeckTarget`'s own
 * built-in default (W5 task 6, {@link resolveDecksDirSource}) — then
 * branches on whether the resolved target is a deck project directory:
 *
 * - directory → `readDeckDir` (assemble in memory — plan + pages/ + assets/,
 *   `./deck-dir.ts`), asset paths resolve against the deck directory itself.
 * - file → the pre-existing single-file path, byte-for-byte: `loadIrFile`
 *   then the same `dirname(resolve(...))` asset base every caller already
 *   used. When `arg` is an explicit path (has a separator, or exists
 *   locally — true of every pre-W5 caller, since every existing test passes
 *   a full path), `resolveDeckTarget` returns it completely unchanged with
 *   no `fs` call at all, so this branch degenerates to exactly the old
 *   inline code — single-file behavior stays byte-identical.
 *
 * `isDir` is threaded back so `runValidate` can gate its dir-only placeholder
 * note on it (single-file mode must never grow that note, even for a
 * hand-authored IR that happens to set `placeholder: true` itself).
 *
 * `projectHit`/`userHit` are the caller's own already-fetched

 * IR, `./deck-dir.ts`) → write the assembled IR as pretty-printed JSON,
 * default `<deckDir>/deck.json` when `-o` is omitted. Deliberately does
 * *not* call `applyDeckConfig` — `assemble` materializes exactly what the
 * plan says (a portable IR file), theme/style overrides are `validate`/
 * `render`/`preview`'s job (each already applies the four-layer chain
 * whether given this same directory or the `deck.json` this command just
 * wrote).
 *
 * `target` must resolve to an actual directory: a target that exists but
 * names a file gets a friendly `expected a deck project directory` error
 * right here rather than reaching `readDeckDir` and failing deeper, with a
 * confusing `ENOTDIR` message, trying to read `<file>/deck.plan.json`. A
 * target that does not exist *at all* is deliberately let through to
 * `readDeckDir` unchanged — its own missing-plan-file error already names
 * the expected layout, strictly more helpful than this shorter message.
 *
 * `-o` resolves against `cwd` (the same fix `resolveDeckTarget` already
 * needed — see that function's own doc comment) rather than the real
 * `process.cwd()`, so a caller that threads a custom `cwd` gets the output
 * where it actually asked for it. When the resolved output directory is not
 * `deckDir` itself, every local asset src is rewritten
 * ({@link withRewrittenAssetPaths}) to stay correct from the new location —
 * otherwise `assets/logo.png` (correct relative to `deckDir`) would silently
 * fail to resolve from wherever `-o` actually put the file.
 *
 * When the plan omitted `seed`, `readDeckDir` (via `assembleDeck`) generates
 * one deterministically and reports it as `generatedSeed` — surfaced here as
 * a suggestion to add it back to `deck.plan.json` for revision stability
 * (spec §5's seed-generation semantics). Never written automatically:
 * `assembleDeck` stays a pure function with no fs side effects, and silently
 * rewriting a file the user did not ask this command to touch would be a
 * worse surprise than asking them to paste one line in.

 * `pages/<id>.json` for every non-placeholder page. Pretty-printed. Key
 * order is already stable because `disassembleDeck` builds every object
 * with the same fixed field order on every call, not by iterating the
 * input, so there is no separate "stable stringify" step to write. Refuses
 * to overwrite an existing `deck.plan.json` — same `wx`-flag EEXIST guard as
 * `runInit`'s config scaffold — so re-running this command never silently
 * clobbers a deck project someone has since started filling in. Page files
 * are freely (re)written since they only exist because this same command
 * produced them, and written concurrently (`Promise.all`) since each is an
 * independent file.
 *
 * Also materializes `assets/` ({@link writeDeckAssets}, `./deck-dir.ts`) —
 * `disassembleDeck` itself never touches `ir.assets.images` (see that
 * function's own doc comment for the full accounting), so this is the step

 * re-assembles and renders with the image silently missing.

 * `pagesDir`/`assetsDir` are only named when at least one page/asset file
 * actually landed there (a plan-only deck with every slide a placeholder,
 * or an assetless deck, leaves either directory unwritten).
 *
 * Every page id is checked with {@link assertSafeFileSegment} (`./deck-dir.ts`)
 * before any `pages/<id>.json` is written (W5 whole-branch review finding 1,
 * CRITICAL — CWE-22): `slide.id` is an unrestricted string at the schema
 * layer, so a hand-authored IR could otherwise set one to
 * `"../../../../escape"` and write outside `outDir`. `writeDeckAssets` below
 * (`./deck-dir.ts`) carries the matching check for asset keys, inside
